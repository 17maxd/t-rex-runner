# T-Rex Runner - debugged version

My goal is to make an AI to beat this game, using Neural Networks.

For that, I need to have a live access to variables such as T-Rex's speed and the incoming cactus distance and size.

As the obstacle apparition is random, the ran distance is not a valid criter to evaluate an AI. I added an obstacles jumped counter.

Below the score digits : *Speed*, *distance*, *size*, and *jumped obstacles*.
